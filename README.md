# Task 1

This file tells about my **Motivation**, **Interests**, and the **Factors** that affect my knowledge. It can have a positive or a negative impact.
I am *Nikhil V*, from the *CSE-AIE* Department at *Amrita School of Engineering*.

## Interests
I have a lot of interests. I have the ability to like new things that I have never heard of. For example, coding was not my domain till, class 12 but from college, I am starting to like it. Also, *I intend to learn a lot of new things*.
My interests are *creative thinking*, *gaming*, *reading books*, *listening to songs*, *watching movies*, and *zoology*.

## Motivation
From a young age, I was **well-motivated** and had the **potential to be self-motivated**. I have this unique character that, if I start a thing then I have this urge to complete it and I will not stop till completing it. 
>I am committed to my goal and passion and I will work to attain it.

But, sometimes these things tend to affect my knowledge. I like to learn and know a great deal of general knowledge but when it comes to curriculum, I am slow. My knowledge also grows because of my desire to learn new things.

### Finally, How I see myself in another 5 - 10 years :
In another 5-10 years, I would be taller and smarter I hope. Also, I wish to be in a *responsible position*. I want my goals and my ambition to be fulfilled over time.
>My interests or motivations might change but my ambitions and goals never.
